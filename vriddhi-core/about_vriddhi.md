# ðŸŽ¯ About Vriddhi Alpha Finder

**Vriddhi Alpha Finder** is an AI-powered personal investment advisor that helps you build optimized equity portfolios based on your target returns, investment horizon, and risk preferences. The application combines quantitative analysis, Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), and comprehensive fundamental research to deliver personalized investment strategies.

## ðŸš€ How Vriddhi Works

### 1. **Target-Based Portfolio Construction**
- Input your monthly investment amount, investment horizon (1-10 years), and target CAGR
- The system evaluates feasibility based on current market conditions and stock universe
- Generates optimized portfolio allocations to maximize your chances of achieving target returns

### 2. **Intelligent Stock Selection Process**

#### **Multi-Factor Scoring System**
Vriddhi employs a sophisticated composite scoring algorithm that evaluates stocks across multiple dimensions:

- **Growth Potential**: Based on quantitative CAGR forecasts across multiple time horizons
- **Value Metrics**: PE and PB ratios to identify undervalued opportunities  
- **Quality Indicators**: Risk-adjusted returns using PEG ratios and volatility metrics
- **Momentum Factors**: Technical momentum scores indicating price trend strength
- **Style Diversification**: Balanced allocation across Growth, Value, and Deep Value styles

#### **Sector Diversification Constraints**
- Maximum 2 stocks per sector to ensure proper diversification
- Automatic sector balancing to reduce concentration risk
- Smart fallback mechanisms when target returns are not achievable

### 3. **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) Optimization**

#### **Cox-Ross-Rubinstein Style Approach**
The portfolio optimization engine uses advanced mathematical techniques:

- **Objective Function**: Maximize expected portfolio return subject to diversification constraints
- **Covariance Matrix**: Diagonal covariance structure assuming independent stock returns
- **Weight Optimization**: Uses `scipy.optimize.minimize` with SLSQP method
- **Constraints**: 
  - Sum of weights = 1.0 (fully invested)
  - Individual stock weights â‰¥ 0 (no short selling)
  - Maximum sector concentration limits

#### **Risk-Adjusted Optimization**
- Incorporates historical volatility data for risk assessment
- Balances return maximization with risk minimization
- Uses Sharpe ratio concepts for risk-adjusted return calculations

### 4. **SIP Investment Modeling**
- Models Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) style monthly investments
- Calculates compound growth projections over the investment horizon
- Provides detailed breakdown of total investment vs. final portfolio value
- Generates month-by-month investment growth trajectories
