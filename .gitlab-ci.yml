# .gitlab-ci.yml

# Use an official Python Docker image as the base for our jobs.
# We choose a specific version (e.g., 3.9-slim) for consistency and smaller image size.
image: python:3.9-slim

# Define the stages of your CI/CD pipeline.
# In this case, we only have a 'test' stage.
stages:
  - test

# Define the 'unit_tests' job within the 'test' stage.
unit_tests:
  stage: test # Assign this job to the 'test' stage
  script:
    # 1. Install project dependencies from requirements.txt
    #    The -q flag makes the installation quiet.
    - pip install -q -r requirements.txt

    # 2. Run your unit tests using the unittest discovery feature.
    #    This command finds and runs all tests in files named test_*.py or *_test.py
    #    in the current directory and its subdirectories.
    - python -m unittest discover

  # Optional: Define artifacts to collect.
  # If your tests generate reports (e.g., JUnit XML reports), you can specify them here.
  # For now, we don't have specific test reports, but this is a placeholder.
  artifacts:
    paths:
      # - test_results.xml # Uncomment if you configure your tests to output XML reports
      - . # You might want to archive logs or other output if tests fail
    expire_in: 1 week # How long to keep the artifacts
